**This is my worklog!****

_Week 1:_
- **Transfered to registration by ID from the table in gspread**
  To login as a student or a faculty member, user should type in only the ID he was given. All the info such as first and last name, gmail and graduation year are stored in a gspread table and is taken from there.
  
-  **Started working on Canvas notifications.**
  To have it done, I need user's secret API key which can be generated from user's account (or I suppose can be generated from organisation's admin's account). For now, I've done a part of the
  frontend - user gets a message that notifications were enabled when he presses the button.
- **Currently planning to make a poll about usage of Discord among the school community.**
    Are Canvas's notifications are good/convinient enough?
    Are Google services convinient to use in different apps?
    Would it be better if all of above were in one app?

    In other words, I'm making a poll which will show how my product wiil be used and will it be used at all?
