**This is my worklog!****
Week 1:**
- Transfered to registration by ID from the table in gspread
  To login as a student or a faculty member, user should type in only the ID he was given. All the info such as first and last name, gmail and graduation year are stored in a gspread table and is taken from there.
- Started working on Canvas notifications. To have it done, I need user's secret API key which can be generated from user's account (or I suppose can be generated from organisation's admin's account). For now, I've done a part of the
  frontend - user gets a message that notifications were enabled when he presses the button.
